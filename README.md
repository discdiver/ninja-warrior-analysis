[American Ninja Warrior](https://www.nbc.com/american-ninja-warrior) is a televised competition in which contestents try to complete a serious of obstacles as quickly as possible, without falling. My kids loved watching the show. Who knew it's been nominated for 3 Emmys?

The [Fantasy American Ninja Warrior](http://www.anwfantasy.com/members/contestants/season10.php) website from Travis McClure provides info about contestant results. Data for seasons 1 through 11 is on the website, but not super easy to use.

In this notebook I scraped 11 years of American Ninja Warrior (ANW) contestant data, combine the data, create visualizations, and perform exploratory analysis. 

The notebooks in this repository can be used interactively at [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) or viewed and downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/discdiver/ninja-warrior-scrape/).

## Executive Summary

Most contestants only appear a few times.
