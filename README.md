#  American Ninja Warrior Webscraping, Visualization, and Analysis

[American Ninja Warrior](https://www.nbc.com/american-ninja-warrior) is a televised competition in which contestents try to complete a serious of obstacles as quickly as possible, without falling. My kids loved watching the show. Who knew it's been nominated for 3 Emmys?

The [Fantasy American Ninja Warrior](http://www.anwfantasy.com/members/contestants/season10.php) website from Travis McClure provides info about contestant results. Data for seasons 1 through 11 is on the website in HTML, but not super easy to use.

In the first notebook I scraped American Ninja Warrior (ANW) contestant data from 11 pages and combined the data into a usable format. In the second notebook, I created visualizations perform exploratory analysis to answer the following questions:

- How does the distribution of the number of appearances for each competitor look?
- How many people appeared at least seven times in the eleven years?
- Who has the most cumulative fantasy points?
- Who had the most fantasy points in a single season?
- How has the average number of fantasy points per contestant per season changed over time?
- How has the average number of participants per season changed over time?
- What's the relationship between the number of appearances and the number of fantasy points?

The notebooks in this repository can be used interactively at [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) or viewed on and downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/discdiver/ninja-warrior-analysis/).
